             Rail
         </h1>
         <p class=rail2>
            The Absolute Logistics team is experts in designing and implementing rail programs. 
         </p>
         <p class="rail2">
            We help shippers setup these programs through our relationship with the Class 1 railroads, short-line railroads, our <a href="Warehouse.html" class="hyperlinks3">nationwide network of trans-loaders</a>, and local last mile carriers.
         </p>
         <p class="rail2">
            If the shipper or the consignee are not rail served let us handle and implement the program. 
         </p>
         <p class="rail2">
            Whatever barriers shippers have had in using rail in order to accomplish freight savings, Absolute Logistics is uniquely qualified to help you overcome those barriers.

             Benefits of Rail Shipping
         </h2>
         <ul class="rail4">
            <li>Reduce transportation costs over long distances</li>

            <li>Expand into new markets that once were too costly</li>

            <li>Cost certainty with locked in rates - no hassle with dealing seasonal swings of the truck market</li>

            <li>Reduced carbon emissions – is 9 times more energy efficient than trucks</li>

            <li>Increased carrying capacity per shipment – 1 boxcar is equivalent to 3-4 trucks</li>

            <li class="rail5">Shorter lead times - when paired with a warehouse facility get resupply shipments to your customer next day vs longer transit times when sending trucks from across the country</li> 
         </ul>
         <h2 class="rail3">
