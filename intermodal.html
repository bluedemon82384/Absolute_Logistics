            Intermodal & Drayage
        </h1>
        <p class="rail2">
            Intermodal shipping is a great and often underutilized method of transporting freight. Moving freight by rail can often be cost efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than other transportation methods.  
        </p>
        <p class="rail2">
            Absolute Logistics works with the Class 1 rail road system to transport freight via intermodal all over North America: US, Mexico and Canada.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="intermodal2">
            When to ship using intermodal rail?
        </h2>
        <ul class="rail4">
            <li>Your shipment travels over 500 miles</li>
            <li>Your shipment weighs under 42,500 pounds</li>
            <li>Your shipment can be loaded into a container/trailer up to 53 feet in length</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="rail2">
